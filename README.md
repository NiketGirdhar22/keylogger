# Keylogger with Encryption and Email Notification

This project implements a keylogger using Python, which captures keystrokes, encrypts them, and periodically sends them via email. The program encrypts keystroke logs using symmetric encryption (Fernet) and securely transfers them to a specified email address.

## Features
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures keystrokes, including special keys, and timestamps each entry.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts logs using Fernet symmetric encryption to protect captured data.
- **Email Notification**: Sends the encrypted keystroke log via email every 60 seconds.
- **Decryption Tool**: Allows decryption of stored logs for review.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger.git
   cd keylogger
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. [Enable less secure app access](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) in your Google account for the email sender.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries:
  - `pynput`
  - `cryptography`
  - `smtplib`

## Configuration
1. Open `test_1.py` and `maillogs.py`.
2. Update the following fields with your email details:
   ```python
   sender_email = "your-email@gmail.com"
   receiver_email = "receiver-email@gmail.com"
   email_password = "your-password"
   ```
3. (Optional) Update the email schedule time in seconds within the `schedule_email()` function in `test_1.py`.

## Usage

### Starting the Keylogger
To start capturing keystrokes and receiving logs by email:
```bash
python test_1.py
```

### Decrypting Keystrokes
To view the captured and encrypted keystrokes:
1. Ensure the `encryption.key` and `encrypted_keystrokes.txt` files are in the directory.
2. Run the decryption script:
   ```bash
   python decrypt.py
   ```
   
### Checking SMTP Connection
To test the email server connection:
```bash
python stmp_check.py
```

### Testing Email Logs
To manually send a test email with the current log file:
```bash
python maillogs.py
```

## Notes
- Logs are encrypted and stored in `encrypted_keystrokes.txt`.
- Encryption keys are saved in `encryption.key`. Keep this file secure as itâ€™s necessary for decryption.
- Email logging is set to every 60 seconds but can be adjusted in `schedule_email()`.
